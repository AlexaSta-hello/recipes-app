      <div className="header-description">
      <p>This app is a personal project built with React, created as part of an Udemy 
        course by Laith Harb. The goal was to explore and implement React concepts 
        while developing a functional and user-friendly application. Powered by the 
        Tasty API, it offers a wide range of vegan recipes, from sweet to savory.</p>
      <p>With the app's intuitive search function, you can easily find recipes using 
          tags and keywords that match your preferences. Each recipe has its own 
          dedicated page with detailed instructions, a list of ingredients, and a 
          nutritional breakdown to help you make informed decisions.</p>
      <p>Whether you're cooking for yourself or planning a vegan feast, this app is 
         here to inspire your culinary creativity!</p>
